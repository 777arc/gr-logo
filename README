* Beamer Theme

The file beamerthemeGNURadio.sty is a theme file for Beamer/Latex
presentations that use the GNU Radio logo and color scheme. Any GNU
Radio-based presentation is encouraged to use this theme. The theme
uses the gnuradio_logo-black.eps file, so make sure to put both of
these files into the right location for your Beamer project to find
them (easiest just to keep them in the directory as your .tex file).
